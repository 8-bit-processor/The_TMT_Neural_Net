# The_TMT_Neural_Net
This is the simplest possible neural net and it's written clearly in plain English.
While this code doesn't explicitly include attention mechanisms or layers, it's fascinating to consider how these
features are analogous to the hierarchical organization of cortical layers on the homunculus of a real human brain,
where different regions process distinct aspects of sensory information.

The sigmoid activation function can be seen as analogous to the delicate dance between neurotransmitters and
receptors, where signals are transmitted and regulated. Similarly, the dot product and loss calculation mirror the
complex processes of receptor upregulation and downregulation that occur in biological systems.

As someone who grew up imagining science fiction concepts like AI as mere fantasy, I'm amazed to see this
technology not only becoming a reality but also improving at an exponential rate.  It's obviously going to get better 
and outperform us everywhere.
